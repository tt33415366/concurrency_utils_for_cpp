## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Lock-free Queue
- Read relevant chapters from "C++ Concurrency in Action" (Ch 7 on lock-free data structures)
- Study Linux kernel coding style guidelines
- Design queue interface (push, pop, empty, size) following Linux style
- Implement using atomic operations and proper memory ordering
- Handle ABA problem (likely using hazard pointers)
- Write basic unit tests
- Verify code style compliance

### Phase 2: Thread Pool
- Read relevant chapters (Ch 9 on thread pools)
- Study Linux kernel coding style for concurrency patterns
- Design thread pool interface (submit, shutdown, etc.) following Linux style
- Implement using lock-free queue as task queue
- Handle worker thread management
- Write basic unit tests
- Verify code style compliance

### Phase 3: Testing
- Expand test coverage for both components
- Test edge cases and thread safety
- Add stress tests for concurrent usage

### Phase 4: Benchmarking
- Design benchmarks for queue operations
- Measure throughput under contention
- Benchmark thread pool task processing
- Compare against standard implementations

### Phase 5: Documentation
- Write API documentation
- Document design decisions
- Create usage examples

## Key Technical Considerations
- Linux kernel coding style compliance:
  - 80-character line limits
  - Kernel-style braces
  - Tab indentation (8 spaces)
  - Naming conventions
  - Minimal comments (self-documenting code)
  - Error handling via return values

- Memory ordering (likely acquire/release semantics)
- Handling the ABA problem in the queue
- Proper shutdown sequence for thread pool  
- Exception safety
- Minimizing cache contention
