# Lock-Free Queue and Thread Pool Project Plan

## Project Overview
Implement a C++11 library featuring:
1. A lock-free queue using atomic operations
2. A thread pool built on the lock-free queue
3. Comprehensive tests and benchmarks
4. Complete documentation

## Technical Approach
- **Lock-free queue**: Implement using compare-and-swap (CAS) operations
- **Thread pool**: Work-stealing design with queue-based task distribution
- **Testing**: Google Test framework with concurrency tests
- **Benchmarking**: Google Benchmark for performance metrics
- **Documentation**: Doxygen with kernel-doc style comments
- **Code style**: Linux kernel coding style (80 char lines, kernel-doc)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Lock-Free Queue (2 weeks)
- Design atomic operations interface
- Implement core queue functionality
- Basic unit tests
- Initial documentation

### Phase 2: Thread Pool (1 week)
- Design worker thread management
- Implement task scheduling
- Integration with queue
- Basic functionality tests

### Phase 3: Testing (1 week parallel)
- Comprehensive unit tests
- Concurrency stress tests
- Valgrind memory checks
- Test coverage analysis

### Phase 4: Benchmarking (1 week)
- Throughput measurements
- Latency profiling
- Comparison with alternatives
- Performance optimization

## Documentation
- API reference (Doxygen)
- Usage examples
- Design rationale
- Performance characteristics

## Code Style
- Follow Linux kernel style guidelines
- 80 character line limits
- Kernel-doc comment format
- Clang-format enforcement

## Milestones
1. Lock-free queue complete - Week 2
2. Thread pool functional - Week 3
3. Tests passing - Week 4
4. Benchmarks complete - Week 5
5. Documentation finalized - Week 6

## Risk Management
- Concurrency bugs: Addressed through extensive testing
- Performance issues: Identified and optimized via benchmarks
- Memory model complexity: Documented thoroughly
