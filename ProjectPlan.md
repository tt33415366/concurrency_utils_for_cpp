## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Lock-free Queue
- Read relevant chapters from "C++ Concurrency in Action" (Ch 7 on lock-free data structures)
- Design queue interface (push, pop, empty, size)
- Implement using atomic operations and proper memory ordering
- Handle ABA problem (likely using hazard pointers)
- Write basic unit tests

### Phase 2: Thread Pool
- Read relevant chapters (Ch 9 on thread pools)
- Design thread pool interface (submit, shutdown, etc.)
- Implement using lock-free queue as task queue
- Handle worker thread management
- Write basic unit tests

### Phase 3: Testing
- Expand test coverage for both components
- Test edge cases and thread safety
- Add stress tests for concurrent usage

### Phase 4: Benchmarking
- Design benchmarks for queue operations
- Measure throughput under contention
- Benchmark thread pool task processing
- Compare against standard implementations

### Phase 5: Documentation
- Write API documentation
- Document design decisions
- Create usage examples

## Key Technical Considerations
- Memory ordering (likely acquire/release semantics)
- Handling the ABA problem in the queue
- Proper shutdown sequence for thread pool
- Exception safety
- Minimizing cache contention
